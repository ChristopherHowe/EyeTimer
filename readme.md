# Eye Timer
Personal project I created just to create a way for me to make sure I take a break every now and then to look away from my screen.
Pretty simple and straightforward uses gnome and systemd systems.

# Install
```bash
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```
# Uninstall
```bash
chmod +x uninstall.sh
./uninstall.sh
```
